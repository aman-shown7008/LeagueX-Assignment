# Inspiration & Difficulties
In this project first I have to think and learned about the structure and layout of web Application.After that I learned how to fetch the data and apply Filteration.Then i think how to Show data while we are offline and also Give pop-up for Offline/Online.In this I also learned about various hooks and some more property of a CSS and designing the front-end part also.Thankyou
